Project Description:
I am making colorSwitch which is a game played on the phone.
In this game the player has to make a ball cross various obstacles and collect points.
The player can make the ball jump by pressing the space bar.
The ball will only cross an obstacle if the colors of the obstacle and ball are the same.
When the ball crosses a white square 1 point is added to the score.
Once the ball collides with a different colored obstacle, the game ends and the users score for that game is diplayed.

The game also has a double player mode, where two players can play simulatneously.
The game ends when one player collides into an obstacle.
The other player wins the game.

How to run the project?
The use should run this in an editor

How to install any needed libraries?
I used tkinter for my project, it is already built in.
